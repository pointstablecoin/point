Merge Coin
==========

The Merge Coin is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency, the engine and the connector to the products and solutions of [Merge](http://www.projectmerge.org).

Some of its features are:
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions.
- Proof-of-work for the first blocks with GPU-resistant algorithm.
- Proof-of-stake and masternode to support the network and reward those users that hold the coin.

Merge bridges the gap to crypto and provide a platform that will allow non-crypto developers to build apps or projects that interact with the blockchain. 
Such a platform helps forming a common ecosystem with an underlaying business logic protocol that we call The Membrane.
This common ecosystem will be based on the core concept of Merge, which is incorporating other coins and their ideas by means of a coin swap.
